Structuring the analyze and compare tabs around neighborhoods, instead of individual sensors with their sometimes strange names, will be more intuitive for our audience. If we can make a new variable that categorizes each reading/sensor by neighborhood, we could then have a dropdown on these pages where users can select the neighborhood they are interested in.

If time allows, having the ability to compare “Neighborhood X” to “Greater Cincinnati” or even “Cincinnati” to “Newport” might be useful.
